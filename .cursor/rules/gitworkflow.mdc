Git workflow rules: 

(1)  return to the targer branch (in this case, dev), then git pull --rebase 

(2)Go back to your work branch and use

git checkout paul-feature2-abc43

git rebase dev

resolving conflicts (maybe need git add for a file after conflict resolved)

git rebase --continue

Because git rebase rewrites commit history, a normal git push will fail. You need to "force push" to update the remote paul-feature2-abc43 branch.

so use: git push --force-with-lease origin paul-feature2-abc43

Open a Pull Request (PR), Use "Rebase and merge" on github
